excerpt: 'In order to treat quantum cosmology in the framework of Weyl spacetimes we take the first step of extending the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism to Weyl geometry. We then obtain an expression of the curvature tensor in terms of spatial quantities by splitting spacetime in (3+l)-dimensional form. We next write the Lagrangian of the gravitation field based in Weyl-type gravity theory. We extend the general relativistic formalism in such a way that it can be applied to investigate the quantum cosmology of models whose spacetimes are endowed with a Weyl geometrical structure.'

You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using **MathJax**, as on [math.stackexchange.com][1]:

The *Gamma function* satisfying $ \Gamma(n) = (n-1)! \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N} $ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

> **Tip:** To make sure mathematical expressions are rendered properly on your website, include **MathJax** into your template:


### UML diagrams

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

And flow charts like this:

```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end
op=>operation: My Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```
