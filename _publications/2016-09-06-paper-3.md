title: "Cosmological models in Weyl geometrical scalar-tensor theory"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'We investigate cosmological models in a recently proposed geometrical theory of gravity, in which the scalar field appears as part of the spacetime geometry. We extend the previous theory to include a scalar potential in the action. We solve the vacuum field equations for different choices of the scalar potential and give a detailed analysis of the solutions. We show that, in some cases, a cosmological scenario is found that seems to suggest the appearance of a geometric phase transition. We build a toy model, in which the accelerated expansion of the early Universe is driven by pure geometry.'

We investigate cosmological models in a recently proposed geometrical theory of gravity, in which the scalar field appears as part of the spacetime geometry. We extend the previous theory to include a scalar potential in the action. We solve the vacuum field equations for different choices of the scalar potential and give a detailed analysis of the solutions. We show that, in some cases, a cosmological scenario is found that seems to suggest the appearance of a geometric phase transition. We build a toy model, in which the accelerated expansion of the early Universe is driven by pure geometry.
