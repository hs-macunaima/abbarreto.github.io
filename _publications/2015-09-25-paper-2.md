excerpt: 'We extend one of the Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems in general relativity to the case of some scalar-tensor gravity theories in which the scalar field has a geometrical character and space-time has the mathematical structure of a Weyl integrable space-time (WIST). We adopt an invariant formalism, so that the extended version of theorem does not depend on a particular frame.'

We extend one of the Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems in general relativity to the case of some scalar-tensor gravity theories in which the scalar field has a geometrical character and space-time has the mathematical structure of a Weyl integrable space-time (WIST). We adopt an invariant formalism, so that the extended version of theorem does not depend on a particular frame.
