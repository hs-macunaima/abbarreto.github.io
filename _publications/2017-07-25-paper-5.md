excerpt: 'We consider scalar-tensor theories of gravity defined in Weyl integrable space-time and show that in the ADM formalism Weyl transformations corresponding to change of frames induce canonical transformations between different representations of the phase space. In this context, we discuss the physical equivalence of two distinct Weyl frames at the classical level.'

We consider scalar-tensor theories of gravity defined in Weyl integrable space-time and show that in the ADM formalism Weyl transformations corresponding to change of frames induce canonical transformations between different representations of the phase space. In this context, we discuss the physical equivalence of two distinct Weyl frames at the classical level.
